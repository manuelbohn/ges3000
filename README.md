## Structure

The file `ges3000.Rmd` presents the supplementary material, which includes code for all analysis reported in the main manuscript and the supplementary material. 

A rendered version of the supplementary material can be found at: https://manuelbohn.github.io/ges3000/ges3000.html

Raw data files are stored in `data/`. 

Stimuli pictures used for experiments reported in the sections **Initiation of communication and uptake of signalling**, **Communicating abstract concepts**, **Conventionalization** and **Drift to the arbitrary** can be found in `stimuli/stimuli_ges_d1.png`.

Pictures used for the additional data collection for **Drift to the arbitrary** are shown in `stimuli/stimuli_ges_d2.png`.

Example videos for the drift to the arbitrary comprehension study can be found in `stimuli/drift_to_arbitrary_comprehension/`.

For the section **Grammatical constructions and communicative pressure**, pictures used for the conditions *size* and *number* are shown in `stimuli/stimuli_number_size.png` and for *movement* in `stimuli/stimuli_movement.png`. 

All pictures used in *transitive 2* and *transitive 3* can be found in `stimuli/stimuli_trans_all_pictures.pdf`.
